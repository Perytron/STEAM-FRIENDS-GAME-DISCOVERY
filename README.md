# STEAM-FRIENDS-GAME-DISCOVERY
A quick and dirty HTML parser implemented in Python which serves the purpose of discovering which games a group of friends has in common.

First off, go to your or your friends library, hit "left-click" and click on "View Source...". This will open up the text editor. You'll now want to save the generated file in this projects root directory and name it however you want, just pay attention that it end in ".steam". Now it's just the matter of firing up the parser by double clicking "parser.py" and voil√†!
